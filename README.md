# ancestral-waves
Simulations of ancestral waves for the continuum, Wright-Fisher and Moran models.


# Requirements


To compile the C programs, we need [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/)
and [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). Both of these are commonly available
in package managers.

On Debian/Ubuntu, for example, we can use
```sh
# sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev libconfig-dev
```
